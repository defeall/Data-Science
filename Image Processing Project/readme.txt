The main purpose of this process is to extract all the images from our database that have same color and pattern as the user input image have. It can be use for tile patterns or for other house pattern like I have choosen the dataset named as samples.

In this project this was peformed by using three main methods
1) Using K-means clustering top 2 dominant color of an image is extracted.
2) Using a self made method to extract all the images that comes under the criteria set by me
3) Using SIFT technology method to match the patterns between two images
